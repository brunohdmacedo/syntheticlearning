"There are also a number of domain-specific developments that improve syn-thetic data generation for specific fields. For example, Cheung et al. [110]
present LCrowdV, a generation framework for crowd videos that combines a
procedural simulation framework that concentrates of movements and human
behaviour and a rendering framework for image/video generation, while An-derson et al. [19] develop a method for stochastic sampling-based simulation of
pedestrian trajectories (see Section 2.3)." [Survey, p52]
